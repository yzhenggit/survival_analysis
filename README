The codes provided in this notebook are based on analytical analyses in Feigelson & Nelson (1985). The method used here is called nonparametric univariate survival analysis based on Keplan-Meier product-limit (PL) estimtor and Gehan or Logrank two-sample tests. It is designed to answer the following question:

I have two left-censored univariate datasets, say, data1 {𝑥𝑖}, i=1, 2, .., N1 and data2 {𝑥𝑗}, j=1, 2, ..., N2. Both datasets have detections and upper limits (or lower limits; but can't have both simultaneously). What is the possibility that data1 and data2 are drawn from the same (unknown) distribution? 

Below is a quick example of how to run the tests. Please refer to survival_analysis_univariate_problems_censored_data.ipynb for a more detailed read.
> import numpy as np 
> data1 = np.array([50, 30, 60, 80, 23, 66, 33, 99]) # measurements, include both detection and limits
> delta1 = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]) # 1=detection, 0=upper limits
> data2 = np.array([32, 9, 5, 100, 60, 73, 29, 88, 1, 30, 60])
> delta2 = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
> from survival_analysis_yz import two_sample_test_censored_data
> p_G = two_sample_test_censored_data(data1, delta1, data2, delta2, weight='Gehan', censored_type='upper_limit')
> p_L = two_sample_test_censored_data(data1, delta1, data2, delta2, weight='Logrank', censored_type='upper_limit')
> # if you have data with lower limits, then indicate censored_type as 'lower_limit'
